            <p>This is an example of the chatbot that we built using Natural Language Processing(NLP) model with personality added that can chat as if you are talking to other person behind the curtains</p>
            <h1>Why add personality?</h1>
            <p>Research has shown that one we chat/talk to anyone whether if it's machine or other persons,we assign personality to it knowingly or unknowingly.So for better experience we further trained our NLP model with Harry Potter`s movie transcript
                to provide our chatbot with his personality as for the demo on how personality can be assigned to it. </p>

            <h2>Why Use Chatbots and Conversational AI?</h2>
            <p>More and more companies want to leverage chatbots, either to build an advanced product based on AI, or improve their internal productivity.<br> Here are a couple of examples:
            </p>

                <div class="col box one">
                    <h2> Support Efficiency</h2>
                    <p>The most popular chatbot application is to automatically help customers without having to rely on a support person. It dramatically improves reactivity, and it alleviates the support team so they can focus on very advanced questions
                        only. A good support chatbot is able to search documents for customers, answer contract or technical questions, detect customer tone and intent...</p>

                <div class="col box two">
                    <h2 class> Video Games</h2>
                    <p>Some video games now include conversational AI capabilities, so players can naturally discuss with the machine. It makes modern games much more interactive, especially because modern conversational AIs can adapt their tone to the situation
                        (anger, joy, sarcasm...).</p>

                <div class="col box three">
                    <h2> Product Suggestion</h2>
                    <p>It's sometimes hard for a user to find what he's looking for, especially if there're a lot of products or if the products are complex. In that case, building a chatbot to help customers and point them to the right product is a very
                        good solution.</p>
